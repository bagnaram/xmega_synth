\begin{abstract}
The problem of an easy-to-use music-making device has been one that countless designers have tackled with a different approach. The balance between niche usage, low cost, and usability has been difficult to balance. Many designs that exist are for specific usages and the typical unification of these devices may seem redundant. Also, the marriage between such a device and hobbyist development may be too focused. The objective of this project is to design and construct a polyphonic digital synthesizer. Unification of the device into an educational kit would satisfy the satisfy the curiosity of the hobbyist. A successful synthesizer will require a well-constructed input device and a microcontroller or processing platform. The synthesizer shall incorporate pulse, triangle, and noise tracks, as well as a means of mixing/synthesis. envelopes are anticipated, as they would allow much more musicality in dynamics. financially, the construction of the synthesizer is to remain within a set budget. optimally, the synth will be able to play music in real-time by the user and read data from a memory a modest key entry device shall be constructed for the user to interact with the hardware directly. the synthesizer should also include the ability to configure \& display the interaction to the user in some kind of gui. the intent of this project is to construct a synthesizer that could be used by hobbyist and beginners alike. this would require an interface with enough usability for both amateurs and hobbyists.

The process of creating a synthesizer of this nature requires looking at the problem from the viewpoint of the users who would be using it. The device was created using low-cost materials, but also looked advanced into emerging technologies such as the XMEGA architecture. The development was done in such a way to facilitate free and fair-use of all development tools, and facilitated the knowledge of skills that would be practical and useful.  This motivated the design of the software to all be accomplished using a POSIX environment. Also, the choice to use a PS/2 keyboard married legacy hardware, and new. The keyboard was chosen as an item that many users may have lying around could just plug-in without purchasing expensive hardware. This design caters to students and hobbyists alike.

The results of the design process display a functioning synthesizer prototype that is able to play real-time music, and also play recorded data. The project functions as a whole, only needing finalizations on the user-interface to conjoin the to modes of operation. Polishing is still needed, and the testing thus far reflects that. Nonetheless, this design is still a prototype with future capabilities down the pipeline.

\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Needs}
Electronic synthesizers are internationally found as means of communicating creative musical content. Chiptune is an an application of electronic synthesizers that emulate the classic 8-bit or early electronic music using the limited hardware of the time. While the ability to interpret sound data directly to a synthesizer is not new, the investigation of such a project would be an enjoyable learning experience, and perhaps create a new approach to an existing product.  The device could be directed towards construction as a kit; as such the intended users could be hobbyists and students who wish to construct a device they can use, while learning from it. This covers the major initial decision to license the project as it has been. The design and customization can be tailored to a specific usage. Also, the usage of limited hardware is anticipated to cost less.

A typical synthesizer is capable of real-time synthesis \& playback. Songs are likely stored in a removable media which can be swapped for recording. The sound emitted from a typical polyphonic electronic synthesizer is in the form of arbitrary waveforms, including a noise track for percussion.

Synthesizer kits are also available to be built and operate. The user may prefer to purchase a commercial available option, However, a custom-made synthesizer will offer all the ability of hardware chiptune creation with the functions of a modern synthesizer at a modest price preferable under USD\$200. 
  \subsection{Objectives}
The objective of this project is to design and construct a polyphonic digital synthesizer. A Successful synthesizer will require a well-constructed input device and a microcontroller or processing platform. The synthesizer shall incorporate pulse, triangle, and noise tracks, as well as a means of mixing/synthesis. Envelopes are anticipated, as they would allow much more musicality in dynamics. Financially, the construction of the synthesizer is to remain within a set budget. Optimally, the synth will be able to play music in real-time by the user and read data from a memory A modest key entry device shall be constructed for the user to interact with the hardware directly. The synthesizer should also include the ability to configure \& display the interaction to the user in some kind of GUI. The intent of this project is to construct a synthesizer that could be used by hobbyist and beginners alike. This would require an interface with enough usability for both amateurs and hobbyists.
\clearpage
\section{System Overview}
The main idea is to create a synthesizer that can interface the user through a keyboard or other key entry device. The input shall allow the instrument to be played in real-time. The user interface or display can be navigated to select different sounds or waveforms(instruments/voices) in this mode. The secondary mode allows the playback of external music data which can be connected to a workstation computer to play data. The user display would be utilized in this mode to select the music data or file to be played. The output audio would be a consumer audio interface which can be later amplified or connected to a speaker.

    \end{figure}
    \subsubsection{Concept Blocks}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Main Processor}
          The main processor will handle user input from the keyboard and the user interface. It will drive the user display, and handle the data-transfer abstraction from the user. It will also interpret the music data, whether it be MIDI, etc., and generate data for use in synthesis.
        \item{Keyboard}
          The keyboard provides the basic user interaction for real-time music creation. The keyboard may be a prefabricated accessory, or may become its own block.
        \item{User Interface}
          The user interface allows the user to select which song to play on the external media.
        \item{Synthesis}
          The synthesis software block is where the waveform generation occurs. Music data generated by the processor is formed into arbitrary waveforms and amplified using an envelope function\
        \item{Enclosure}
          The enclosure will provide adequate housing for its use as a synthesizer. Looks and aesthetics will cater to usability for amateurs and hobbyists and could feature a retro design.
        \item{Data Transfer}
          The data-transfer will provide support for external media. This will facilitate the transfer of external music data for use in playback. The data can be fabricated on a workstation computer and played back on the synthesizer through this transfer interface.
      \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Developmental Plan}
    The development plan for the synthesizer will divide between the hardware components and the software development. About 25\% of the project will involve hardware. The following table will record this breakdown of the subsystems.\\
    \begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Itemized subsystem development}
    \vskip 0.3cm
    \small
    \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{  l p{2.1cm} l X X }
      \textbf{Subsystem} & \textbf{Dev Ratio} & \textbf{Dependencies} & \textbf{Software} & \textbf{Hardware}\\
      \hline
      PS/2 keyboard & 0.10 & Processor & PS/2 driver & Connector:proto\\
      LCD display & 0.10 & Processor & LCD driver & protoboard\\
      External SD & 0.20 & Processor & SD library available & \\
      Synthesis & 0.25 & Processor & Software synthesis & Hardware mixer\\
      Processor & 0.45 & N-A & Software operating system & Dev board\\
    \end{tabularx}
    \end{table}

    The development ratio gives an idea of what amount of time will be spent on each subsystem. 

    The order in which development shall carry out will tentatively follow this pattern:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item{\textbf{Processor}}\hfill \\
      Processor development shall start first and begin with the hardware board being created or chosen. Currently, the choices are to use an AVR developmental board or an AVR programmer using a custom created proto-board or perf-board. 

      The software component will also begin and initial development can begin concurrently until the build environment is established. Current software choices are leaning toward the usage of a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) The processor software will be a large component of this development as the abstractions for runtime are formed in this stage.
      \item{\textbf{Synthesis}}\hfill \\
      Synthesis development will be tightly integrated with the processor platform. The software development can begin first, following usage of the processor as its resource. The wavetable and sampling routines are to be developed at this point. Following creation of the software synthesis component, the hardware DAC may be chosen for sound output.
      \item{\textbf{External SD}}\hfill \\
      Perhaps one of the more complex peripherals, the SD storage device shall be incorporated into the runtime of the processor. The current anticipated solution is to include an SPI\cite{FFoust2004} SD library and work with that. The hardware component of the SD interface shall be incorporated into the development board being used.
      \item{\textbf{PS/2 Keyboard}}\hfill \\
      The PS/2 keyboard requires no assembly because it shall be obtained as a finished component. The software-level driver shall be written into the runtime of the processor, and will be interfaced via serial peripheral on the processor platform\cite{website:avinash}. The hardware port will be placed on the development board for testing and usage.
      \item{\textbf{LCD Display}}\hfill \\
      The LCD display requires no assembly because it shall be obtained as a finished component. The software-level driver shall be written into the runtime of the processor, and will be interfaced via the software specification of the LCD display, most likely being SPI. The hardware port will be placed on the development board for testing and usage.
      \item{\textbf{Mechanical Plan}}\hfill \\

      Mechanical chassis focuses on a small profile enclosure. The material of choice for the enclosure will most likely be wood or 3D printed to keep costs low. Figures \ref{fig:3d1} \&  \ref{fig:3d2} display a rendering using \textit{Valve Hammer Editor} of what the chassis may look like. It features a mounting for the LCD display and main power switch on the front. The rear will provide fixtures for the DB-9, power, and TRS connectors. The right side will feature a slit to clear the turn potentiometer as it protrudes from the enclosure.
    \end{enumerate}

      \clearpage
\section{Subsystem Technical Descriptions}
  Much of the testing being done will feature the debug menu which will be incorporated into the development board. The debug menu will feature self-tests documented in \nameref{sec:testing-documentation} to use to verify functionality of the peripherals. The tests will run using an external serial interface on the processor and can be accessed using a serial terminal.\par
  \subsection{Synthesis subsystem}
    The Synthesis subsystem consists of the software \& hardware which creates the output waveform from the digital data being created by the processor. This subsystem is composed of software routines that create a audio buffer to write out to the DAC as well as the routines for mixing the separate buffers. This subsystem is vital to the tonal generation of music. First of all, to verify the proper operation of the synthesis portion, the waveshape, frequencies, mixing, and other parameters need to be validated. 

    Synthesis is being done in both hardware and software, so both components are required. To ensure proper generation of arbitrary waveforms, the output of the synthesizer shall be connected to a 50 ohm terminated oscilloscope. The visual oscilloscope tube can be used to capture the correct waveshape for each voice. Next, the frequency range of the synthesizer will be tested using the built-in sweep function in the debug menu. The oscilloscope can, again, be used to capture the frequency vs. time data to verify this part. The voltage levels of the waveforms can also be checked at this point. The final task to verify would be the mixing capability of the synthesizer by generating polyphonic tones in the form of two, and three note chords. This may be verified by viewing a frequency-domain plot on the oscilloscope.
  \subsection{LCD display subsystem}
    The LCD unit consists of the LCD display, as well as the display driver being written on the software. The LCD subsystem will act as the user's interface to the synthesizer when it is being run in real-time for playback or for playback of premade audio. The purpose of this display is to provide the user with an interface. 

    The LCD will operate using a user-created driver and the output shall be connected using a parallel interface. First, the verification of the display of characters will simply be done by cycling through printable ASCII characters. This will be done using the functionality of the debug menu. Also, the processing of control characters and clearing the screen will be demonstrated using this same debug screen.
  \subsection{PS/2 Keyboard subsystem}
    The keyboard unit consists of the PS/2 display, as well as the PS/2 driver running in software. This subsystem is used to provide key entry to the synthesizer block. It is vital to the synthesizer as it provides the only keyed input from the user. It will be used as the musical keyboard, as well as the controls to the user-interface on the LCD. 
  \subsection{Processor subsystem}
    The processor platform subsystem consists of the microprocessor platform being used, as well as the software layer being run on it. This subsystem is the heart of the synthesizer platform, as it interfaces with all peripherals, and all software will be written on. 
    \vskip 0.25cm
    \textbf{Hardware}\hfill \\
    The hardware platform for this processor subsystem will be an ATXMega256D3. This processor will feature 256 kilobytes of programmable flash memory, and port-assignable timers. The selected clock will be a 16KHz crystal. Programming will be done via PDI using an AVRISP MKII. PWM timers output from the microcontroller mixed and filtered will be used to perform the waveform generation.
    \vskip 0.25cm
    \textbf{Software}\hfill \\
    The software of the processor platform will ideally provide hard or soft real-time support through use of a real-time operating system. The motivation of the operating system is to accomplish real-time tasks within stringent deadlines. \cite{0595375979}Because this system will be processing audio samples, a real-time operating system will be used to timely produce the music. As depicted in Figure ~\ref{fig:software0}, the software for the synthesizer will be divided into tasks which interface with a particular peripheral.
  \subsection{SD card subsystem}

   The SD unit consists of the SD card interface, as well as the software filesystem driver being used to interface via SPI. The SD subsystem provides the synthesizer a method to playback non-volatile memory or per-recorded sequences. To verify the proper functionality of the SD device, the creation of file handles, and reading of blocks should be demonstrated.

    The SD will operate using an available FAT\_FS \cite{website:fatfsnotes} library, and the input shall be connected using an SPI  interface. Because the synthesizer will only be reading music data, the demonstration will require the ability to read off the SD card. This subsystem is integrated into the processor platform, therefore, it requires the processor subsystem to be tested. The demonstration will require the creation of a file handle, and reading the blocks of data into memory of the processor. The debug program on the processor will read ASCII data off the SD card and output it via its external serial interface.\\

        \includegraphics[]{img/fig_asciimessage}
        \caption{ASCII message structure}
        \label{fig_asciimessage}
    \end{figure}

    Figure~\ref{fig_asciimessage} above depicts the preliminary data-layout chosen for the scope of each playback sequence. This data represents a sequence of messages that composes a tune being read from the SD in ASCII mode. As a result, filesizes will be much larger, but this is at the expense of creating an easily modifiable human-readable format. 

    Next, the ASCII messages are then evaluated and an associating \texttt{order} object is created to represent the item. A library was designed for the purpose of representing a linked-list datastructure. An executive decision was made at this point to represent the data using a linked-list. Although a linked-list does not allow random-access of data, they provide insertions and deletions to occur in constant time $ \Theta(1) $\cite{sedgewick2011algorithms}. This was evaluated due to the amount of messages that would be processed. The library used consists of the \texttt{onode} structure which points to the data containing the actual music.

    Figure \ref{fig_onode} shown above is used as the encapsulation method for the \texttt{order} tone data. The data is represented above in \ref{table_order} and this data is passed on to the synthesis block to process the indivudual messages that come in. Because these messages are passed asynchronously, they are not long-lasting in the life of the execution cycle. Transformation occurs fast, yet the structure used would allow future expandability for more complex tone messages.

\section{Testing Methods, Results and Evaluation}
  \subsection{Subsystem Test Plans}

      Testing for LCD unit functionality was successful as shown in Table~\ref{tab:lcd_unittest}. The testing was done on a stub development board ATMEGA16. Functionalities demonstrated were the ability to display two-line character buffers to the screen, presenting custom glyphs as characters, contrast adjust, and clearing the screen. The requirement for this test maps to requirement \#2 to provide an intuitive user interface. The LCD testing results will demonstrate this ability in conjunction with the keyboard to develop a menu system. See Appendix~\nameref{sec:testing-documentation} for test setup.

      Testing for the PS/2 was successful using the ATMEGA16 as shown in Table \ref{tab:ps2_unittest}. Functionalities demonstrated were the ability to read scancodes from the keyboard on key press and key release events. Because the intent is to use the alphanumeric keyboard for key entry, only level1 scancodes will need to be interpreted. This test maps to the requirement to provide an intuitive user interface, as well as a means to input data for playback. See Appendix~\nameref{sec:testing-documentation} for test setup.


      Testing for the SD storage was successful as shown in Table \ref{tab:sd_unittest}. The SD was damaged during testing and yielded inconclusive evidence. With recent acquisition of the SD card breakout board, testing can continue. The requirement for this test will map to requirement \#3, and \#4. Although inconclusive at this point, the testing will continue. See Appendix~\nameref{sec:testing-documentation} for test setup.


Testing of the synthesis unit is complete in conjunction with the processor platform testing as depicted in Table \ref{tab:synthesis_unittest}. Because of the tight integration between these two subsystems, development was done on the same platform. Functionality to demonstrate is the ability to generate compound waveforms from arbitrary waveform buffers. The simplest of these would be to output an arbitrary waveform scaled to frequency f. This will be used to generate a chromatic frequency sweep. Noise, generation will follow. Superfixing two waveforms will create two simultaneous tones at 440Hz and 460Hz. Three tones will be superfixed next to create deeper chord structure at 440, 460, and 520Hz. Finally, square and triangle waveforms are tested. This testing sequence will demonstrate the requirement of \#7 and \#6. See Appendix~\nameref{sec:testing-documentation} for test setup.


Testing of a processor platform demonstrates overall functionality of the microprocessor. Testing was be done in a stateless mode of operation to ensure proper functionality of the unit. Metrics observed in Table \ref{tab:processor_unittest} were poweron functionality, and PDI advertisement.

  \subsection{Integration Plans}

Integration of the subsystem blocks will follow an order which allows the system to be joined logically. The listing below illustrates the 5 phases of integration.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Processor platform}
    \item{LCD display}
    \item{SD storage}
    \item{Synthesis}
    \item{PS/2 keyboard}
  \end{enumerate}

With the synthesizer, the initial block will be the processor platform. This will represent the base for which all subsequent tests will be dependent on. This subsystem is vital to all subsequent tests. 

Second, the LCD display will be added with its hardware and software functionality. This integration will be vital to provide the user with an interface that can be used for testing further on. The initial LCD test will be the same test used in the LCD subsystem testing because it is essentially the same.

Third, the SD storage will be integrated with its FAT library component, as well as the hardware interface. The testing for this stage will include reading ASCII data from the card and writing it to the LCD display. This test will be part of the debug system as it is being built for integration.

Next, the synthesis subsystem can be integrated with its software components. The synthesis subsystem will make usage of the incrementing debug system being built up. The tests of this integration will involve simple waveform generation, more sophisticated chord synthesis and generation, and noise track synthesis.

Last, the PS/2 keyboard will be integrated into the system. The PS/2 keyboard testing can be used in conjunction with the LCD to display an intuitive menu that can be navigated using the keyboard. Testing for this integration will facilitate the creation of a whole debug-menu system that can be navigated and displayed on the LCD.
The final system integration step will test some of the Engineering requirements as a whole to ensure proper functionality throughout. These tests will address the requirements listed in Table 2.1.2 . This will include tests of reading data from the SD card and playing back. Also, the system will need to allow real-time playback when set to that state.

Testing for the processor integration stage went successful. The stage of testing began with the testing board layout. The testing board layout is explained in Appendix J - Test Board. The processor is the first stage to be integrated onto the testing unit. This was done by simply inserting the processor assembly into the testing board via DIS1 and connecting the programmer to CONN1. The processor integration provides the base for which all subsequent integration steps will follow. For this reason, the processor integration needed to be checked for integrity while interfacing the testing board. The demonstrations for this integration step simply required power to be supplied correctly to the processor assembly, as well as detecting the presence of the processor by the PDI interface.

Second stage of integration includes the physical LCD display along with software used by the LCD to interface. The reason for choosing the LCD to integrate second was to facilitate a means of standard output to be used for further integration tests. The LCD needs to be tested using its software library to ensure proper display and visibility of data. The first line of testing is to ensure proper voltage to the logic supply of the LCD as well as to the lighting unit of the LCD. Next, the contrast adjusting functionality is tested being integrated to the testing board to ensure proper visibility adjustment of the display. The library is put to the test being integrated into the development environment of the processor. Testing display of buffered text to the LCD was successful at this stage.

The SD card interface is the next stage to be integrated, following the plan of iteration. The SD interface consists of primarily a software library titled FAT\_FS and a SPI SD interface connectivity board. The integration of the SD library was vital to ensure proper functionality and correct any conflicts that may have been present on the databus. The software was consolidated at this point to make the software development blocks independent and able to be separated for individual unit tests. This proved to be successful because the sequence of filesystem tests integrated nicely into the testing board. The final testing demonstrated reading of ASCII data from a file on the SD and displaying it to the LCD.   This was used to facilitate the reading of music data.

The PS/2 keyboard interface was the next integration step. This step required the use of the PCA9306 level shifter IC to interface 5V with the 3.3V logic of the microcontroller. The integration implemented a routine in the main execution thread to fetch the contents of the PS/2 message buffer. This buffer contains the scancode, shift flags, and press/release flags.

      Synthesis integration was final as it required use of the other subsystems to test and debug. Synthesis was tested by assigning frequency values to each key and testing the response of the key messages into tone production. The synthesis was also divided into three buffers to be tested using key configurations.

  \subsection{Final Test Plans}

  Final testing of the project will demonstrate adherence to the specifications outlined. The metric used will quantify the measurable requirement in the Requirements.

        \hline
      \end{tabularx}
      \end{table}

      The specification testing above will illustrate proper and sufficient user interface traversal. The User interface is to be evaluated at this point. This will include menu layout and features. The response of the interface to navigate to various modes of operation is to be tested via response times. The complexity of the menu subsystem as a whole is also to be evaluated via enumeration of submenus.
      As of the time of this report, the menu-system needs to be polished towards being a final user interface. The menu system needs to be established as a whole, and implemented as a front-end to the system.

      Specification test 2 will demonstrate the synthesis component of design. It focuses on frequency generation, and response. These variables can be measured as before during the sbsystem tests. Nothing needs to change for them. The PS/2 response is implemented at this point, becasue the keyboard serves as the entry-point to asynchronous tone generation. This can be evaluatied spatially via response time as well. This test is a lengthy process and so far, not all the frequencies have been verified. Response times can be measured using instrumentation.

      Specification test 3 deals with the tertiary playback and sequencing of said data. The SD card serves as the filesystem platform for the loaded music data. As a result, the SD should be initialized and detected through the filesystem. This module can be tested as the subsystem test went, with the inclusion of the individual response times of loading a song from the SD while ignoring underlying file representations. Files should begin playing within a certain interval of being loaded from the device.

      Additional tests to be performed will deal with usability and longterm usage. The uptime usage is scalabale and will be much more difficult to measure, as memory will need to be inspected to verify any leaks. Tools can be utilized in software such as \textit{Valgrind} but may be increasingly difficult to use without a JTAG debugger. Memory integrity will have to be measured by practice observation. Exception handling will have to be observed in the same way using structured test routines, along with arbitrary usage metrics.

  \section{Conclusions \& Recommendations}
 
 So far at this stage in development, the project is in its final physical form. The PCBs are mounted to the enclosure. A few minor issues were observed with the final form of the project with the following handlings. First, the wiring of the data and power pin on CONN5 were incorrectly swapped and this issue was mitigated through an external dongle to reverse the pins. Next, the volume potentiometer POT1SW was improperly selected, resulting in clipping waveforms at high volumes. As a result, the potentiometer will be sunken to the enclosure and be designated as a tuning adjuster because hardware volume adjustment was never an endorsed requirement specification. 

At this current stage, the project is slightly behind schedule. The desire was to have all final development complete to facilitate adequate system testing for the demo. As of now, the testing cannot begin until the final user-interface is completed and finalized. This will take a little time, and in due time to be completed on schedule (see \nameref{schedsched}). It will only requre more time input on my end in the next week.

Looking ahead, the next steps would include the final testing and development of the software user interface. This would include the final user environment menu system on the LCD along with the keyboard assignments and user-instruction manual. The development for the user interface of the design will facilitate all keys being used for tone generation and specific rows of keys for each buffer(sine/square/noise).

\section{Testing Documentation}
      \label{sec:testing-documentation}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{LCD Tester}}\hfill \\
    The data bits are connected to PORTA. The control bits are connected to PORTD[7..5]. A common ground and +5V must be established between the microcontroller and the testing board.\par

      The microcontroller will be loaded with the 'lcd8bit' hex file and will complete the tests automatically upon running. The microcontroller will display a short message on the first line of the display. Following, custom glyph characters will be displayed on the second line of the display. The core functionality of the display such as clearing and modifying will be done using these tests.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/testdoc_lcdtester}
      \caption{LCD tester layout}
  \end{figure}

    \item{\textbf{PS/2 Keyboard Tester}}\hfill \\
    The PS/2 keyboard will be connected to the 6-pin mini DIN connector which is coupled to the microcontroller board. The mini DIN requires an adaptor to DB-9 to connect easily for testing. For the usage of the test, a DB-9 to mini-DIN adaptor dongle will be used. The dongle connector is wired as follows:
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
      \includegraphics[]{img/testdoc_dongle}
      \caption{PS/2 Dongle pinout}
  \end{figure}

    The opposite side of the connector will be jumpered to the microcontroller board on PORTB; with clock being B.2 and data being B.1. A common ground and +5V must be established between the microcontroller and the testing board.

    The PS/2 tester will display the regular scancode for the last key being pressed or released on the LEDs using PORTC. The press and release scancodes are displayed here.
    \item{\textbf{SD Card Tester}}\hfill \\
    The SD card breakout board will be connected using jumper connections to the microcontroller board. Because the SD breakout board includes a level converter, there is no voltage issue using +5V. The wiring is shown. PORTB is used for to connect to the breakout board. The SD is inserted into the slow when powered down. Only regular SD cards may be used with size up to 1GB.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
      \includegraphics[]{img/testdoc_sd}
      \caption{SD board pinout}
  \end{figure}

    The microcontroller is loaded with the 'sd\_test.hex' hex file and powered with the SD card in place.
    \item{\textbf{Processor}}\hfill \\
    The processor testing environment is established through a rudimentary PDI programming interface. The essential build environment requires this interface and a powered processor. With a fundamental environment created, it is possible to verify communication via the PDI programmer. This test will make use of the AVRISP mkII programmer.

      The first test requires a verification of the processor device. This consists of a request by the development workstation and a simple reply advertisement by the processor. This can be simply executed by issuing \texttt{avrdude -p x256d3 -c avriskmkII -P usb} in the terminal of the workstation. A valid response from the processor would be a device signature of \texttt{0x1e9844} when using the ATXMEGA256D3.
      \label{processortest}

    \item{\textbf{Integration Platform}}\hfill \\
      The integration platform was designed for use throughout the subsystem integration phase of the project. Each individual hardware subsystem can be exclusively attached and detached from the platform. This allows comparative testing to be done using any integration regression.

      Standard connections are as follows:
